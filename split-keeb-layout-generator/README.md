# Keymap
Adapting [@BrokenFlows/keymap](https://github.com/BrokenFlows/keymap) (via [@callum-oakley/keymap](https://github.com/callum-oakley/keymap)) for my keymaps.

Below is my 46-key keymap.
Other keymap graphics can be seen in their sub-directories.

Instructions on how to adapt this repository for your own key maps can be found in [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

Legend:
- Keys joined by a short arc are combos, accessed by pressing both keys at once
- Red keys are held to access layers or modifiers
